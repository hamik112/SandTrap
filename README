This project is for a PHP script that will add any IP address that accesses it
to a blacklist file.  This blacklist file can then be accessed by any other
script on the server to determine which IPs should be delivered false content.

Intended requirements for using this script:
- access to execute PHP
- access to read and write files from within PHP
- robots.txt file access

Installation:
  1. Copy sandtrap.php, banip.php, and blacklist.txt to the same directory on
     your server (this directory must be accessible by direct HTTP access)
  2. Modify robots.txt to disallow traffic pointing to the location of banip.php
  3. Upload robots.txt to the root of your website heirarchy
  4. Add the following code to the top of all PHP files that you want to be
     blocked (modify sandtrap.php to point to the correct location):
        require_once("sandtrap.php");
